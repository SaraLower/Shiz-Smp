<h2>History</h2>
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
In the start it was just Scruffy, Shizard, Sara.
 They began to explore and sn found a place to settle. 
 This would later be known as Shiz zentral. They started ot with just three bed,
  some crafting tables, and a chest all placed in the center of the island. As 
  time passed they all began to start their own places.
<h3>The Rath of Ally</h3>
Ally was a former member of Shiz Smp. 
She settled in a cherry biome dirrectly across from Jungle Lions former castle.
 This are is now Milo's Cherry Grove City. She later got kicked out of Shiz Smp for some ongoing conflicts. These conflicts resulted in the burning of two out of her five houses. It also resulted in the accidentel killing of her pets. Her main house is now a wonderful fountain made by Milo.
